It embeds this information invisibly in standard HTML. By\r\nbuilding on standard HTML, it automatically inherits well-defined support\r\nfor most scripts, languages, and common layout options. Furthermore,\r\nunlike previous OCR formats, the recognized text and OCR-related\r\ninformation co-exist in the same file and survives editing and\r\nmanipulation. hOCR markup is independent of the presentation.\r\n\r\n### The programs\r\n\r\n    hocr-check file.html\r\n\t\r\nPerform consistency checks on the hOCR file.\r\n\r\n    hocr-combine file1.html file2.html...\r\n\r\nCombine the OCR pages contained in each HTML file into a single document.\r\nThe document metadata is taken from the first file.\r\n\r\n    hocr-split file.html pattern \r\n    \r\nSplit a multipage hOCR file into hOCR files containing one page each.\r\nThe pattern should something like \"base-%03d.html\"\r\n\r\n    hocr-eval-lines [-v] true-lines.txt hocr-actual.html \r\n\r\nEvaluate hOCR output against ASCII ground truth.  This evaluation method\r\nrequires that the line breaks in true-lines.txt and the ocr_line elements\r\nin hocr-actual.html agree (most ASCII output from OCR systems satisfies this\r\nrequirement).\r\n\r\n    hocr-eval-geom [-e element-name] [-o overlap-threshold] hocr-truth hocr-actual\r\n    \r\nCompare the segmentations at the level of the element name (default: ocr_line).\r\nComputes undersegmentation, oversegmentation, and missegmentation.\r\n\r\n    hocr-eval hocr-true.html hocr-actual.html    \r\n    \r\nEvaluate the actual OCR with respect to the ground truth.  This outputs\r\nthe number of OCR errors due to incorrect segmentation and the number\r\nof OCR errors due to character recognition errors.\r\n\r\nIt works by aligning segmentation components geometrically, and for each\r\nsegmentation component that can be aligned, computing the string edit distance\r\nof the text the segmentation component contains.\r\n\r\n    hocr-merge-dc dc.xml hocr.html > hocr-new.html \r\n    \r\nMerges the Dublin Core metadata into the hOCR file by encoding the data in its header.\r\n\r\n### About the code\r\n\r\nEach command line program is self contained; if you have the right\r\nPython packages installed, it should just work.  (Unfortunately, that\r\nmeans some code duplication; we may revisit this issue in later\r\nrevisions.)\r\n\r\n### Pointers\r\n\r\nThe format itself is defined here:\r\n\r\n    http://docs.google.com/View?docID=dfxcv4vc_67g844kf&revision=_latest\r\n\r\nThe project is hosted here:\r\n\r\n    http://code.google.com/p/hocr-tools/\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
